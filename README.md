+Description-This is the working code for all of the projects that were required of me this semester. Within each week is an activity and project if we were required to do any coding for those particular projects. 
+Installation Instructions-In the main page of this repository, click on the green button that says "clone or download." Then click on "download zip" to install all of the code of all the projects that we have completed in this course. 
+Usage-This is a mockup site of everything that was required of us in our assignments. The site is functional and you can scroll amongst different pages as well. The point of the site is to get a call to action which is for a customer to sign up to this example personal training business.
